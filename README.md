# Exercise 2-2 : Palindromes.java

A palindrome is a word that can be read in both directions. The distinction between upper and lower case does not matter for reading a palindrome.
If we ignore non-alphabetic characters (i.e. ' ', ',', '-' et '\''), a complete sentence can also be considered as a palindrome.
Write a Palindrome.java program that:
o readsastringofcharactersfromthekeyboard;
o purify(orrathertoprintacopy)non-alphabeticcharacters; o andtestsifthechainthuspurifiedisapalindrome.
Example:
For this program, you should use several predefined methods of the String class, such as charAt (), toLowerCase (), and length ().
